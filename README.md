Project Name - Kitchen Recipes.

Project Description

A web application that helps you discover new recipes based on your preferences. Whether you're in the mood for a specific cuisine, meal type, or have dietary restrictions. The application leverages the Edamam API to provide a range of recipes, allowing you to explore various cuisines.

How to use

1. Clone the repository.

2. Sign up for an Edamam account to access the Recipes API, which requires an app_id and app_key.

3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

4. Fill out the search form with your preferences:

   - Cuisine: Choose from a variety of cuisines using the provided list or enter your own.
   - Meal Type: Select Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner.
   - Dish Type: Choose from Main Course, Sandwiches, Drinks, or Desserts.
   - Dietary Restrictions: Select any dietary restrictions you have or choose "None" for no restrictions.
   - Number of Recipes: Choose the desired number of recipes to display.

5. Click the "Search Recipes" button to retrieve and display recipes based on your criteria.

   Note: If the API doesn't yield recipes that match your criteria, the results section will be blank, and an error will be logged.

6. Explore the results, including recipe names, images, calorie information, ingredients, and cooking time.

7. Your search is saved under the 'Search History' section.
